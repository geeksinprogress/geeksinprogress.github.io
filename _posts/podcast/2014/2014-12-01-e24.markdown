This week on Sunshine and Frank: trailers are released for Jurassic World and some other nerd movie, Nintendo patents emulators for its devices, controversy erupts over a map exploit in Dreamhack Winter's CS:GO tournament, and more; we discuss the future of consoles, new interfaces, and dedicated casters vs pro player casters in esports.
